            My name is Dana Chen. I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. I am a Shift Leader at Panda Restaurant Group. I enjoy working on my own as well as with others to share ideas in order to grow my knowledge. I am currently reading Fierce Conversations
            by Susan Scott and the Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. These books are guiding me to find my truth and to become a leader through conversations. Additionally, I am taking the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp to develop and strengthen skills to
            search for a career in the tech industry.

            My interests include cooking various Asian dishes, baking sweet treats, and going to the gym. My priority is to maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing physical activity as well as have a healthy mindset. I enjoy making cookies and would love to start baking
            cakes and pies, especially for the holiday season. I have many gym goals, including achieving my first unassisted push and pull ups! I also want to challenge myself to deadlift 135 lbs for 5 sets of 8-12 reps by the end of 2019.
