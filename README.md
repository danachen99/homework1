# Homework 1 - Portfolio

## Starting a non-responsive portfolio

This is my portfolio, which is currently non-responsive, meaning it exists but does not lead to external links and does not allow the user to submit any information. It has an about me page (index), a contact page, and a portfolio page. The three pages (html files) are all linked together so that the user can navigate back and forth between each. The contact page contains a form for users to fill out their information and message to contact me (owner). The portfolio page, which is currently non-responsive, only contains images and faux projects for now. 

The CSS file is used to style the heading, main content, and the footer of the pages. The goal of this is to create the skeleton or the initial layout of my portfolio. With this, I am able to understand what I need to do in order to style my page in the future, such as through various containers and element sizing. 

The portfolio page is currently incomplete, but should contain five containers with photos and a description. The purpose of this is to create a page for future projects to include.
